- Automation is nice, but hard to achieve: Prone to creating new errors, things
  to understand, things that can  go wrong
- Bad automation is determined by context, and is not absolute. What's perfect
  for one context is terrible for another.
- Being surprised by what the automation is doing is as common as it is bad, the
  more surprises the more your trust is eroded
- Surfacing what's going on and what's happening inside the automation is of
  utmost importance, otherwise nobody can follow along
- Failing gracefully and with as much information as possible is the only way to
  retain trust
- All software and automation is written in a context, its measure is how
  quickly and how severly does it fall apart once it leaves that context?
- Every option for configuration you add makes the automation more onerous to
  learn, model, keep track of, and trust.
- The more output your automation produces, the more mental load it requires to
  keep track of.
- In the times when mental load is highest, most automation is most likely to
  fail (because the context is shot) and so it produces more load.
- This makes people seek to "escape the automation", and limit its use to begin
  with, to curtail this.
- You, as the autor of software/automation, can't predict how people are going
  to use your software or automation because you are bound by your knowledge and
  context of it. Seek to talk to people that are actually using it daily.
