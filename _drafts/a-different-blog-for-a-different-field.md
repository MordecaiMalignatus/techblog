title: "A Different Blog For A Different Field"
---

Since I started setting aside time to read every single day, a lot of ideas have
come bubbling up for me to write about, clustered relatively tightly around my
interests in Human Factors, Resilience Engineering and Safety Engineering. These
are _relatively_ related to one another, explore different facets and different
sides of the general topic of "How do people exist in [tech] organisations?".

This does not really fit in well with the rest of the things I've written about
at [my other blog][rambling], which is mostly about my personal insights and
realisations, and that's mostly written for myself to get things out into words.

This on the other hand is going to be relatively thematically-focused on these
topics. Everything else, grander ideas, personal things, _et cetera_ is going to
be on the other one.

All that said, here's some things I'm currently drafting:

- Why Machine Learning should never be near operational tooling, and why that
  isn't fixable by making it better at what it does,
- How to write human-friendly operational tooling,
- How to write actually-helpful automation, and
- What happens when you give a person a task that's best suited for a computer.

No guarantees all of those will be published, but this is roughly why I split
this out.
